    <p>
     Ludwig van Beethoven (baptised 17 December 1770 - 26 March 1827) was a
     German composer and pianist. Beethoven remains one of the most admired
     composers in the history of Western music; his works rank amongst the most
     performed of the classical music repertoire and span the transition from
     the Classical period to the Romantic era in classical music. His career has
     conventionally been divided into early, middle, and late periods.
